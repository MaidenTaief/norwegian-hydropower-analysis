# Flood-Dam Risk Analysis

## Overview
This module integrates climate-driven flood scenarios with dam risk assessment, specifically designed to align with PhD research requirements in hydrology and climate impacts in mountain regions.

## Research Objectives
- **Primary**: Assess how climate change alters flood-dam interaction risks
- **Secondary**: Model cascade failure scenarios for Norwegian dam infrastructure
- **PhD Alignment**: Bridge gap between structural dam analysis and operational flood risk

## Data Sources
- **NVE Flood Data**: Flomsone (100/200yr), Climate-adapted zones, Historical events
- **Dam Infrastructure**: Existing NVE dam database
- **Climate Projections**: IPCC AR6 scenarios
- **Population Data**: SSB (Statistics Norway)

## Methodology Framework
Following the research framework suggested by co-author:
1. Rivers overview: trajectories, cities/zones, livelihoods
2. Flood regime: how floods happen & water levels across the year
3. Dam inventory on each river (location along main stem/tributaries)
4. Dam age & dimensions (structural details)
5. Comprehensive data-based risk assessment
6. Weighing how many lives will be affected vs risk
7. Proposing use of SHM and how it can impact so many lives

## PhD Application Relevance
This work directly addresses:
- **Climate-driven hydrological modeling** with flood reconstructions
- **Long-term changes in runoff regimes and flood hazards**
- **Combination of climate modeling with historical event analysis**
- **Mountain catchment flood dynamics under climate change**
- **Applied relevance with Norwegian water authorities (NVE)**
