## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Attention Required:**
   - Focus on dams with risk scores > 60
   - Prioritize Far Arctic and High Arctic locations

2. **Climate Adaptation Planning:**
   - Develop adaptation strategies for dams with >2°C projected warming
   - Consider increased spillway capacity for extreme precipitation

3. **Monitoring Enhancement:**
   - Install real-time monitoring for high-risk dams
   - Regular permafrost stability assessments
