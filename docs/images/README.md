# Sample Analysis Results

This directory contains sample charts generated from the Norwegian hydropower data analysis. These images demonstrate the capabilities of the analysis toolkit and provide a preview of the insights that can be derived from the NVE hydropower data.

## 📊 Available Charts

### 1. Enhanced Reservoir Analysis (`enhanced_reservoir_analysis.png`)
**Six-panel comprehensive reservoir analysis featuring:**
- Reservoir area distribution (cleaned data, outliers removed)
- Logarithmic scale view for better distribution visibility
- Size category breakdown (pie chart)
- Volume distribution analysis
- Top 15 largest reservoirs by area
- Volume vs Area correlation with trend analysis

**Key Insights:**
- ~75% of reservoirs are small (<1 km²)
- Strong positive correlation between area and volume
- Largest reservoir: ~1,089 km²
- Total reservoir area: ~8,220 km²

### 2. Dam Construction Timeline (`dam_construction_timeline.png`)
**Historical development analysis showing:**
- Construction activity by decade
- Cumulative infrastructure growth
- Construction rate analysis (dams per year)
- Historical periods breakdown

**Key Insights:**
- Peak construction: 1960s-1970s (Post-WWII boom)
- Maximum rate: ~60 dams/year in the 1960s
- Total development span: 365 years (1660-2025)
- Post-war boom (1945-1980): 2,831 dams built

### 3. Enhanced Spatial Visualization (`enhanced_spatial_visualization.png`)
**Geographic distribution analysis featuring:**
- Dam lines with enhanced visibility
- Dam points colored by construction era
- Reservoir locations sized by area
- Combined infrastructure overview

**Key Insights:**
- Complete national coverage
- Higher density in southern and western Norway
- 12,763 total infrastructure elements
- Clear regional development patterns

### 4. Improved Reservoir Analysis (`improved_reservoir_analysis.png`)
