This study conducts a comparative analysis of dam infrastructure in India and Norway, to elucidate how contrasting geography, climate, topography and governance regimes yield differing trajectories of development, structural characteristics and spatial distributions. Four analytical lenses are employed—(i) decade-wise construction trends, (ii) age distribution, (iii) height/type classification, and (iv) spatial concentration and governance frameworks. These dimensions collectively reflect the influence of natural environment, design philosophy, and institutional/regulatory governance on long-term dam infrastructure performance.

Decade-wise Trends
In India, the large-dam programme expanded substantially in the decades following independence, with a pronounced surge during the 1970s to 1990s, driven by irrigation expansion, flood control and power generation needs. The National Register of Large Dams (NRLD-2023) compiled by the Central Water Commission (CWC) serves as the authoritative dataset for counts, completion year and related attributes.

 By contrast, Norway’s programme has been characterised by a more gradual but sustained focus on hydropower development in mountainous catchments, with numerous high-head reservoir schemes and system flexibility features. The study by Ingeborg Graabak et al. (2017) illustrates Norway’s hydropower system functioning as a “battery” for variable renewables in northern Europe.

Age Distribution
With completion years skewed toward earlier decades, India’s dam stock is relatively mature. As per parliamentary documentation, of the 6 138 completed “specified” large dams in the NRLD-2023 register, 3 789 are older than 25 years. Digital Sansad+1
 In Norway, while specific age-distribution statistics are less frequently summarised in peer-reviewed literature, the national register maintained by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) monitors ~3 600 registered dams and subjects high-consequence structures to periodic retrofits and supervision.

Height and Type Classification
In India, earthen and composite (earth-fill/rock-fill + concrete) dams of moderate height dominate the inventory, reflecting alluvial topography, irrigation-driven orientations and cost-effective construction regimes. Detailed distributions (by height band and structural type) can be computed from the NRLD dataset.
 In Norway, the rugged relief and hydropower orientation result in many rock-fill and concrete gravity dams associated with large head and storage capacities. Graabak et al. (2017) highlight the Norwegian hydropower system’s operational flexibility and reservoir capability, underscoring typologies that support high-head storage. MDPI+1
Spatial Concentration and Governance Framework
In India, state-wise concentrations such as in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat are evident in the NRLD state-wise breakdown, reflecting major river-basin irrigation and multipurpose dam programmes. Digital Sansad
 Norway’s dams are geographically concentrated in steeper catchments and western/central mountainous counties (e.g., Vestland, Innlandet) where hydropower potential is high. Policy-wise, Norway implements the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and associated national instruments; Hanssen et al. (2016) review Norway’s WFD implementation and its implications for hydropower regulation. journals.open.tudelft.nl
 In India, the Dam Safety Act, 2021 provides a statutory institutional structure (National Dam Safety Authority, State DSCs, etc.), surveillance, inspection and maintenance mandates. India Code+1
Implications
By analysing these four dimensions comparatively, this study seeks to identify how hydrological regimes, topographic constraints, typology choices, age profiles and governance models collectively shape long-term dam performance, sustainability, risk exposure and rehabilitation needs. The findings aim to inform strategies for structural rehabilitation, sediment-management, operational flexibility (including hydropeaking), safety oversight and adaptive policy design in both countries.








Governing Bodies Overseeing Dam Infrastructure in India
India ranks third globally, after the United States and China, [cite CWC] in the number of large dams, with 5,334 operational and 411 under construction, as per the National Register of Large Dams (2019).  the Government of India initiated efforts to unify Dam Infrstaructure Management  in 1979 with the establishment of the Central Dam Safety Organisation (CDSO) within the Central Water Commission (CWC). 
The Central Water Commission, functioning as an attached office under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Government of India, is the premier technical agency responsible for water-resources development and dam safety.
Subsequently, in 1982, a Standing Committee on Dam Safety was constituted under the Chairmanship of the Chairman, CWC, to review existing practices and recommend uniform safety procedures and the need for central legislation. Following its recommendations, the first Draft Dam Safety Bill was circulated in 2002 and revised through successive consultations and Parliamentary reviews, culminating in the enactment of the Dam Safety Act, 2021 (No. 41 of 2021; Gazette Notification S.O. 5422(E), effective 30 December 2021).
The Dam Safety Act, 2021, administered by the Ministry of Jal Shakti (Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation), provides a statutory framework for the surveillance, inspection, operation, and maintenance of all specified large dams in India. It mandates a multi-tiered institutional mechanism at both central and state levels comprising:
 (a) the National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS) – a policy-level body chaired by the Chairman, CWC, to evolve dam-safety regulations and standards;
 (b) the National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) – a statutory authority for implementation, technical oversight, and coordination among States;
 (c) the State Committee on Dam Safety (SCDS) – a state-level policy and review body; and
 (d) the State Dam Safety Organisation (SDSO) – the executive wing in each State responsible for routine inspection, classification, and reporting of dam-safety measures.
The Ministry of Jal Shakti, through Gazette Notifications S.O. 757(E) and S.O. 758(E) dated 17 February 2022, formally constituted the NCDS and established the NDSA, followed by the National Committee on Dam Safety (Procedures, Allowances and Other Expenditure) Rules, 2022 (G.S.R. 134(E)) and the National Dam Safety Authority (Functions and Powers) Rules, 2022 (G.S.R. 135(E)). 


Together, this institutional framework of CWC with the Dam Safety Act 2021—ensures that India’s vast dam infrastructure is governed under a unified, legally enforceable system integrating technical oversight, policy formulation, and state-level execution.
